Female Genital Schistosomiasis

Female genital schistosomiasis (FGS) is a water-borne neglected tropical 
disease affecting millions of women and girls in sub-Saharan Africa. 
It is caused by the parasite Schistosoma haematobium, and is associated with 
adverse reproductive health outcomes including: spontaneous birth, increased 
susceptibility to HIV and STIs, cervical cancer and infertility. 
Here, I present the analysis of the clinical and behavioural risk factors 
associated with FGS infection among women of reproductive age by performing 
association tests, correlation analysis, polynomial regression and logistic 
regression including both binary and multinomial methods.
